## About

**Rustic Delight** is an add-on for <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/farmers-delight">Farmer's Delight</a>, aiming to add new crops, blocks and food items that fit very well within the design philisophy of the original mod and Minecraft itself.
It's recommended to also play with <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei">JEI</a> and <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/appleskin">Appleskin</a> to view recipes and food stats in-game.

##  Features
### ðŸŒ¼ Cotton
Find Wild Cotton in the world and grow your own cotton! Cotton integrates well within the mechanics of both Minecraft and Farmer's Delight, as it can be used to craft String, Paper and Canvas.
This adds a farmer's way of obtaining materials that can otherwise mostly be obtained by hunting monsters! 

Alternatively, you can put Cotton Seeds in a Cooking Pot to make Cooking Oil. This can be used as an ingredient for various recipes.


### ðŸ¦‘ Calimari
Squids and Glow Squids now drop Calimari! Calimari can be cooked, sliced, and turned into a delicious Calimari Roll. It can also be used in many other fish recipes.
